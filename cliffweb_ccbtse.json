When someone speaks, everyone else should stop walking and listen. When they have finished speaking, everyone can move again.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Start by stating personal beliefs or opinions. Stay away from jokes and be as honest as possible. These statements should be simple, even mundane personal opinions. Examples: \"You should never read the ending of a book first.\" ''You should take a nap every day.\" ''You should turn the lights off when you leave a room.\" \"Always yield to pedestrians in a crosswalk.\"<\/li>\r\n \t<li>After walking and sharing statements for a few minutes, form a back-line. Take turns initiating scenes as characters that embody one of the personal beliefs that was shared. The personal belief shared will serve as the inspiration or starting point for a character. Each improviser must use a belief other than the one he or she shared.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>As the scene progresses, ask yourself, \"If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?\" or, \"If this unusual thing is true, then why is it true?\" Even though you are starting with something simple, you can find ways to heighten and explore this initial belief (e.g., the person who believes that you should turn..the lights off when you leave a room might grow into someone who is militant about conservation).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>You don't literally have to repeat the belief as the start of the scene. For example, if you're working off of someone saying, ''You should never read the ending of a book first,\" you might initiate a scene by saying, \"I like to see the mystery of life unfold in the moment.\" You have started your scene with the intent behind this belief but not the exact wording. You should be asking yourself, \"If this type of person never reads the ending of a book first, then what else would they do? What type of person is that to me?\" Maybe this person has always packed up their things in a truck, driven to a new city, and then looked for an apartment.

Again, the third improviser should stop the scene any time either performer in the scene is not acting realistically.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Once the \"unreal\" moment has been discussed, the improvisers should back up and play the moment again in a way that is more realistic.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>PART 4<\/strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>For the final section of this exercise, each pair should be given the suggestion of two character archetypes that are so fundamentally different from their actual selves that they could not ''be\" them in real life. These character archetypes should require the improvisers to alter their voices and physicality (e.g., two elderly people, two Russian immigrants, two characters of opposite gender of the improvisers in the scene, etc.).<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Again, the goal of both players in these scenes is to play these characters in the same grounded, realistic, and truthful manner that they played themselves in Part 1.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>While the improvisers will need to adopt a character voice or different way of moving in these scenes, they should make these traits as realistic as they can.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>The third improviser can once again judge the success of this part of the exercise by looking for how closely these scenes resemble the tone and execution of those scenes in Part 1. This third improviser should now be asking, \"Is this really what either of these types of people would say or do in real life?\" in order to find those moments that are not realistic or genuine.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Once the \"unreal\" moment has been discussed, the improvisers should back up and play the moment again in a way that is more realistic. Stop and repeat this process if the scene again becomes unrealistic.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>ADDITIONAL TIPS<\/strong>\r\n\r\nStart your scenes \"in the middle.\" That means initiating with a specific statement and assuming or labeling a relationship from the start. Starting your scenes \"in the middle\" is a good idea in general. Remember the lessons from the \"TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE\" exercise. In real life, you usually don't just talk about whatever it is that you are doing as you are doing it. You usually talk about lots of other things: work, your family, your friends, interests, etc. Use the scenes in this exercise as an opportunity to practice doing this. The third improviser watching these scenes should stop the scene if the improvisers get trapped into talking about what they are doing.","post_title":"Give the setup","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"give-the-setup","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-17 13:29:59","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-17 13:29:59","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/ccbtse.cliffweb.eu\/?post_type=exercise&#038;p=21","menu_order":"0","post_type":"exercise","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Then distill the Game into five words or less.\r\n\r\nIn distilling the Game of each sketch, don't use specifics or create a plot synopsis.\r\n\r\nExamples: The Game of Monty Python's \"Cheese Shop\" is \"specialty shop that does not sell what it claims to specialize in.\" The Game of Monty Python's \"Dead Parrot\" is \"refusal to acknowledge an irrefutable fact.\"\r\n\r\nOnce you have identified the Game, imagine it existing in another situation with different specifics.

A suggestion will be thrown out by one of the improvisers. Someone else in the group will be inspired to step out and tell a monologue inspired by this suggestion. After the monologue, discuss all of the comedic ideas you heard as a group. One way to recognize interesting or comedic ideas is to listen to what made your group laugh. You should also be listening for what was the essential \"point\" or \"reason\" for the story. (This can often be described as the \"one-line\" version of this monologue.) In addition to this central, core idea, there will often be many great details that are interesting in and of themselves, which will also be great fodder for scenes. Next, go through the comedic ideas one by one and take turns offering scene initiations that attempt to frame the idea in the context of a scene. Use this process: Take the comedic idea and imagine a scene that could come from this idea. Then, try to imagine what the first line of this scene would be. Offer this as your initiation.\r\n\r\nAs a group, discuss which initiations were most successful in clearly communicating the comedic idea you want to explore and an implied base reality.\r\n\r\nYou can add another layer to this exercise by pairing up after discussing the comedic ideas as a group.

Then mingle with the other characters onstage, having two- to three-line exchanges with them.<\/li>\n \t<li>Now only two improvisers take the stage to use this same process to make character choices for scenes. Both improvisers should create characters by changing how they move physically. The improvisers can either choose a body part to lead with on their own, or another member of the group can give them suggestions. The two improvisers should walk around the stage in this new way until they \"find\" characters.<\/li>\n \t<li>The improvisers should once again be thinking, What kind of people walk this way? What do they enjoy? What do they hate? What kinds of things might they say? What is their status (high vs. low)? What is their worldview (optimist vs. pessimist)?<\/li>\n \t<li>Once both improvisers seem ready, have someone else from your group give them a onevword suggestion to inspire a short scene.<\/li>\n \t<li>The two improvisers should be able to incorporate whatever they have decided about these characters into the scene, no matter what the circumstances of the scene are. If your scene partner is the first to speak, and verbally identifies you as a character different than what you have decided upon, you should abandon your character choice and go with theirs while maintaining yourphysical behavior.\nExample: Your movement caused you to feel like you were an old person who has difficulty walking. Before you can make this clear with dialogue, your scene partner interprets your movement as the walk of a toddler and labels you as such. While maintaining the same walk, you should play this scene as a toddler.<\/li>\n<\/ul>","post_title":"Using physical characteristics to create characters","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"inherit","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"36-autosave-v1","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-11-23 15:30:37","post_modified_gmt":"2018-11-23 15:30:37","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"36","guid":"https:\/\/ccbtse.cliffweb.eu\/2018\/11\/23\/36-autosave-v1\/","menu_order":"0","post_type":"revision","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Start walking around the room and acknowledge each other without speaking.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>As you pass each other, you should try to act as if you are a bit higher in status than everyone else you interact with. Each interaction should also serve to increase your status.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Try to find different ways to express your status (e.g., not making eye contact, walking with a swagger, walking with good posture, etc.). After a few minutes, someone will announce that everyone in the group born in the months of January through June should reverse and become lower in status with each interaction, so that about half the group will be going for high status and halflow. After a few more minutes, everyone should go for low status, trying to be the lowest status of every interaction. When you have finished acting low in status, have everyone take a seat and discuss the exercise. Talk about how people with higher status look and behave compared to someone with low status.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Now, only two improvisers get up onstage.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Someone else in the group should assign one improviser to be high-status and the other low status.<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Someone else in the group should give these two improvisers a one-word suggestion to inspire a scene.

You can be a very high status butler and a low-status president. When we talk about status, we are referring to the behavior of the characters, not their assumed status in life.

The actual play is about sexual politics in 1890s Vienna, with scene titles like “The Whore and The Soldier” followed by “The Soldier and the Parlor Maid.” The improv version just borrows the structure and not the focus on sexual politics. If you have five people, it goes like this:\r\nFirst scene has Person A and Person B\r\nNext scene has Person B and Person C.\r\nNext scene has Person C and Person D.\r\nNext scene has Person D and Person E.\r\nFinal scene has Person E and Person A.\r\nIt creates a sort of circle.\r\nYou don’t pick ahead of time who does which scene, and you don’t pick which character. You get a suggestion, and then two people just step out and do a scene. After a few minutes, someone tags out one of the two. Whoever is tagged out becomes Person A and stays on the back line until the last scene.\r\n\r\n1. Everyone should try to be a simple character with a simple “thing,” meaning one of the following:\r\n2. you’re a very familiar archetype (e.g., “schoolteacher” or “drill sergeant”);\r\n3. you have a clear point of view (“perky idealist” or “grouch who hates young people”);\r\nor\r\n4. you have a clear emotional temperament (“cheery” or “sad”).\r\n5. Then, whenever someone tags in, your goal is to put the character from the previous scene into a place that we would never expect to see them. If the first scene is a drillsergeant yelling at a soldier, someone could tag in as a yoga teacher—and thus we see the angry drill sergeant in a yoga class, i.e., a situation we would not expect for that character.\r\n\r\nEveryone ends up doing two scenes. You stay the same character in each of your scenes. It’s implied that everyone lives in the same universe, though that may not matter. Focus on being changeable The trick here is that when the character gets put in the new situation, they must like it. They still behave the same way they did in the previous scene, and the actor comes up with a reason why they like this situation. If you’re the drill sergeant who was yelling and screaming at the soldier, and then you’re in a yoga class, you do the poses with the same angry grunting and yelling that you did in the previous scene. You have some reason why you like yoga. (“I CAN FEEL MY HEART CHAKRA OPENING, MAGGOTS!”) You’re not surprised to be there, and you don’t say you’re being forced to do it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the yoga teacher is being very typical for a yoga teacher, talking in a soothing voice, moving in a slow, fluid way. Then the drill sergeant gets tagged out, and we see the yoga teacher at a heavy metal concert with a heavy metal fan. The yoga teacher loves it and waves his body around and cheers happily in a very soothing way for the heavy metal band.\r\n\r\nIf this seems hard, it’s not. In real life, we often focus on the parts of an experience which we relate to, and ignore the rest. Maybe the drill sergeant is really into the discipline of yoga, and just doesn’t pay attention to the peaceful aspect of it. Maybe the yoga teacher likes the “inner truth” of heavy metal and doesn’t pay attention to all the violent imagery.\r\nGenerally, you keep your tone and your behavior but apply it to a new world. You keep your music, and you change your lyrics. You say “yes” without giving up your central way of behaving","post_title":"La Ronde","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"la-ronde","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-12-17 15:38:00","post_modified_gmt":"2018-12-17 15:38:00","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/ccbtse.cliffweb.eu\/?post_type=exercise&#038;p=55","menu_order":"0","post_type":"exercise","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Here’s an exercise designed to reward you when you do something that is both funny and still productive for an improv scene.\r\n\r\n4–6 people up on the back line. They are the “samurai.” They will be doing the scenes.\r\nAnother 4–6 people along the side walls. They are the “sensei.” The sensei will only be watching the improv, not doing it. (“Sensei” isn’t the historically accurate term, but I find it more palatable than “master” and also more cool to say.)\r\nGive each of the sensei five playing cards and assign to them one of the samurai.\r\nIf Erik is one of the samurai on the back line, you assign Gwen, who is on the side line and holding five playing cards, to be his sensei.\r\nThe samurai get a suggestion and do an improv set. Normal improv set: they edit, they tagout, they do walk-ons.\r\nBut before they start, you give the samurai a mission (examples below). They can all have the same one or maybe they have separate ones. Whenever a samurai accomplishes their mission, their sensei steps out right then and hands them a card.\r\nSensei should err on the side of being generous.\r\nKeep going until all cards have gone out.\r\n\r\n<strong>FIRST ROUND: ACCEPT OFFERS<\/strong>\r\nFirst time I do this, all the samurai have the same mission: ACCEPT OFFERS. Every time they explicitly yes-and something that was just said, their sensei steps out and gives them a card.\r\nIf Sam says to Erik, “Sergeant, I’m exhausted,” and Erik says, “You look exhausted,” then Erik’s sensei Gwen steps forward right then and hands him a card.\r\nThen if Erik keeps going and says, “You should be, having been on watch all night,” and Sam says, “I was out there, but I’m not sure I did a great job,” then Sam gets a card because he’s acknowledging he was on watch.\r\nIt gets tricky\/helpful\/funny when people make accusations and the recipient has to make them true.\r\nIf Arnie steps out and says, “Clarissa, you jerk!” and then Clarissa goes “Shut up, asshole!”\r\nClarissa would get a card.\r\nIt is somewhat subjective what merits a card. The teacher should confirm or deny the first few times cards are given out (“Yep, that’s right,” or “No, he’s not confirming anything,” or even “Where’s the card on that?”), but then try to back off.\r\nOnce the cards are all out, switch sensei and samurai.\r\n\r\n<strong>SECOND ROUND: SPECIFIC MISSIONS<\/strong>\r\nOnce everyone’s had a chance to do the “accept offers” round, do one where each samurai has separate tasks.\r\n\r\n<strong>FUN TASKS TO ASSIGN:<\/strong>\r\n<em>Emotional reaction:<\/em> Get a card whenever you make a pronounced emotional reaction.\r\n\r\n<em>Toys<\/em>: When someone uses an object that you created, you get a card.\r\n\r\n<em>Specificity<\/em>: Whenever you are surprisingly specific, you get a card.\r\n\r\n<em>Made-up proper nouns:<\/em> Any time you make a specific reference to something that is made up (“You guys seen the new Jules Candy film?”), you get a card. Justification: Any time you explain something that was contradictory, you get a card\r\n\r\nPlaying against type: Any time you play someone who is not your gender\/age\/general energy, you get a card.\r\n\r\nYou can still give “accept offers” as a mission here, too.\r\nThese missions are supposed to be easy, fun things that an audience enjoys. They’re no heady logical things like “playing game” or “taking an idea from the opening.” They are things that the audience likes the moment they happen and that generally enrich a scene.\r\n\r\n<strong>THIRD ROUND: GROUP MISSIONS<\/strong>\r\nIn addition to the sensei who are up on the side walls, you can assign students watching to be sensei, looking for missions that anyone in the group can accomplish. These are optional missions that are not any one samurai’s responsibility, and some are accomplished by the group together, as a whole.\r\nWhen the group sensei see their mission accomplished, they should throw a playing card in the air and shout the name of the mission, to indicate it was just accomplished. Some group missions are:\r\n\r\n<em>Stage picture<\/em>: Whenever the group strikes a good stage picture, this sensei throws a card in the air and declares, “Stage picture!”\r\n\r\n<em>Truthful moment:<\/em> Whenever someone in the group says something that is surprisingly truthful, this sensei throws a card in the air and says, “Truthful moment!”Moment of silence: There’s so much frantic talking in improv that an audience appreciates committed silence. Whenever there’s a nice, pregnant moment of pause, this sensei throws a card in air and says, “Moment of silence!” (This ironically both celebrates and ruins it.)\r\n\r\n<em>True love<\/em>: Improv also has so much scattershot meanness and snarkiness that any time there’s a moment of genuine vulnerable sweetness—someone saying “I love you,” a father complimenting his son, a friend helping a friend—this sensei throws a card in the air and says, “True love!\"\r\n\r\nThese missions don’t all have to be completed—meaning these sensei don’t need to get rid of all their cards for the round to be over. It would take too long.\r\nThis can be a chaotic exercise, but if you build up from the first, simple “accept offers” version, it can be a fun celebration of the types of moments that make improv shows fun.\r\nThe sensei are watching more closely than they are maybe used to.\r\nThe samurai focus their awareness down to just one useful task.\r\nThe businesslike action of handing a card to someone is an oddly pleasing punchline for otherwise mundane improv moments.\r\nIt rewards being fun and funny","post_title":"The Samurai","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"the-samurai","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-12-17 16:06:14","post_modified_gmt":"2018-12-17 16:06:14","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/ccbtse.cliffweb.eu\/?post_type=exercise&#038;p=56","menu_order":"0","post_type":"exercise","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Now your hair will look stringy and flawed! And I shall look more beautiful by comparison!\r\nPlayer A: (sympathetically disagreeing) Look, I know that I can be arrogant about my hair, but this is really going too far.\r\n\r\nPROS: Player B practices being the “bad” character while still taking full ownership of the accusation. The sympathetic disagreement prevents Player A from attacking too aggressively. It lets Player B catch their breath and fully digest this position they have been gifted. The exercise is silly and entertaining and fun. It’s clear and easy to measure if you’ve done it right.\r\n\r\nCONS: Resulting scenes are kind of dumb.\r\n\r\n<strong>OWN IT<\/strong>\r\nSame thing, but now Player B must admit to the accusation and explain why as a “normal” person, not a supervillain. Player A still sympathetically disagrees.\r\n\r\nPlayer A: Jeremy, did you forget to invite anyone to this party?\r\nPlayer B: I did it on purpose. I wanted the party to fail, because I’m jealous of you having friends besides me.\r\nPlayer A: Yes, I know I’ve been ignoring you, but you’re acting like a child!\r\n\r\nPROS: As an exercise, it’s still easy to follow. It makes Player B use the accusation as a way of learning more about his or her character. In an improv scene, this strategy will actually work very often.\r\nCONS: Although more natural than the supervillain one, this one can still feel forced and contrived, and the scenes all take on a similar feel.\r\n\r\n<strong>A REAL REASON<\/strong>\r\nSame set up, but this time Player B tries to feel why they would have done such a thing for real.\r\nLike, in real life. The only condition here is that you have to accept without argument that you really have done the thing: you can’t change it so you didn’t do it, or say that you didn’t do it on purpose.\r\nFor example, if Player A says, “Sir, we found these knives and excessive liquids in your luggage. Why were you sneaking these onto the plane?”\r\nIf you were doing supervillain approach, you might say, “So I can take over the skies!”\r\nIf you were doing the “own it” approach, you might say, “Because I plan on using them to bully other passengers up there.”\r\nI actually think both of those responses could work. But if you take a moment and try to feel why you might really have done it, I bet you’d take a moment to consider, and then say something like this:\r\n“You know, I was just hoping you wouldn’t check. I thought I could get away with it. I think the TSA policies are kinda dumb. I’m not planning anything bad, and I just didn’t care to follow your rules.”\r\n\r\nPROS: The answers are rich, specific, and have the ring of truth that makes improv compelling. This is what the best improvisers often do when endowed with a strange situation. It is the best approach in actual scenes.\r\n\r\nCONS: It’s hard to measure, from the student’s perspective, if you’ve done this right.\r\nStudents don’t necessarily know what truth feels like on stage. And since there are so few restrictions on how you respond, many students will inadvertently deflect: “I don’t know!\r\nSomeone else must have put them there!” or “Ach, I took the wrong bag by mistake!”\r\nThe exercise basically says “be good actors and be interesting people,” which is not the most helpful instruction, but this is the best approach in a scene.

The spouse, the boss, the crazy friend. It feels natural, but a scene can’t really get started until the people in it talk to each other about each other.\r\nIn real life, we rarely talk to each other about each other. We’re scared to do it, or it feels rude.\r\nBut for our improv scenes, we have to get comfortable speaking directly.\r\nA good exercise to practice this is to do two-person scenes in which each person must start their lines with “I,” “you,” or “we.” Do this until you feel the scene has found a game.\r\nMaking a scene about the characters we can see generally makes the scene more powerful.\r\nHere’s a scene between Chris Kula and Billy Merritt.\r\n\r\nChris enters as a customer in line at a counter, looking up over a cashier at a menu.\r\nBilly enters to be the cashier. He adopts a stern face and stares intently at Chris.\r\nChris: Hmmm, I’m not sure what to get.\r\nBilly: Look at me.\r\nChris: What? No, I…\r\nBilly: Don’t look up there. Look at me. I will help you. Look right at me.\r\nThat subtle bit, just saying “look right at me,” was enough to get the audience laughing. Now the actors still had work to do to determine what the scene was about.\r\nChris: No, I just am not sure what…\r\nBilly: You want to see The Revenant?\r\nThe Revenant was a real movie out at the time.\r\nChris: I’m not sure. I saw an ad for it and it didn’t really grab me.\r\nBilly: All we have here is The Revenant. I got rid of the other movies.\r\nThe game of this scene is a movie theater that has only one movie.

{"ID":"62","post_author":"1","post_date":"2018-12-17 20:25:58","post_date_gmt":"2018-12-17 20:25:58","post_content":"“Sound and movement” is a kind of opening. It is notoriously weird and annoying, and is one of those things that seems so useless at first that it will make you doubt whether you should be doing improv at all.However, there are also great lessons to be learned in it—about letting go and letting the animal part of your brain make decisions before your inner judge screws it all up. About hearing and reacting intuitively, versus struggling to figure out a logical move.\r\nDoing a sound and movement and then immediately doing scenes will bring out a confidence in many players that they previously did not have. It will get people out of their heads. It will make them play more physically and less hesitantly. It’s a great thing to do as an exercise to\r\npractice playing more boldly.\r\n“Sound and movement” is a version of “follow the follower,” so let’s explain that first.\r\n<strong>Follow the Follower<\/strong>\r\nIn “follow the follower,” the whole group stands in a circle and starts in a neutral position.\r\nThen the teacher says go. Everyone should start copying and heightening each other, meaning: whatever you see someone else doing, you start doing, but more.\r\nAt first, because everyone starts in a neutral position, you will just be copying very gentle sways and twitches. Then you will amplify those sways a bit—into a more pronounced, exaggerated version. Then people will copy the way you are swaying, but they’ll do it even more.\r\nNo one leads. You just copy. Any time you see two or three people doing something, you just start doing it, only more. No thinking, just doing. If anyone makes even the slightest sound or even breathes in a noticeable way, you copy that.\r\nThere is a group-wide agreement that you will let the action change and morph easily. Don’t get stuck doing any one thing for too long.\r\nYou can make non-verbal noises, meaning no actual words. Commit, meaning you do the physical gestures with full enthusiasm, as opposed to shyly doing them just a little bit. The group can break out of the circle if it naturally happens and start wandering around the room like dust particles, all still copying each other.\r\nDo this for 3–5 minutes.\r\nIn general, exercises of follow the follower tend to be a bit similar. You will get tired of them if you do too many within a short period, but they are a great warm-up that forces you to get out of your head, pay attention to others, and give up control. They’re silly in a way that makes you get over yourself so you can do improv.\r\nBy itself, this is a good warm-up to do in a class.\r\n\r\n<strong>Sound and Movement<\/strong>\r\nNow, a “sound and movement” is like follow the follower, but you start with a suggestion, and there’s a bit of structure thrown in.\r\nYou get a suggestion, and everyone starts doing a physical activity or motion inspired by the suggestion. Simple and bold is best. If it’s “kettle,” you all start miming that you’re pouring kettles, while making the sound of hot steam pouring out. Everyone copies each other, and, using your “follow the follower” technique, this quickly morphs into an abstracted physical repetition that doesn’t really mean anything.\r\nWhatever it is you’re doing will morph a few times. You’ll be pouring kettles and making steam noises, and then you’re just sort of waving your arms up and down in front of you while making some kind of whooping noise, and then you’re all skipping around the room, and then you’re all jumping up and down saying the word “jump” over and over.\r\nThis is where you wonder if you should be doing improv at all. Stay with us, please.\r\nWhat you’re looking for as a group is for your sound and movement to become something recognizable and real. At the point I just described, maybe it almost looks like you’re shooting basketballs, so someone just goes ahead and makes their motion into shooting a basketball.\r\nSomeone else notices and also starts shooting a basketball. And for a few moments you stop doing a “follow the follower” and you’re just doing about 20 seconds of shooting basketballs around. You might fill out the scene. Someone goes under a hoop to catch rebounds and throw the ball back in. You pass to each other.\r\nThen, after 20 seconds or so, you go back into “follow the follower” mode and let it become abstract. Things morph and change until you find another recognizable situation.\r\nThink of your sound and movement as having “hallways” and “rooms.” The hallways are the abstract portions, where you’re just doing follow the follower. The “rooms” are when it temporarily becomes something real.\r\nYou do this until you’ve had 3–4 rooms, and then you try to end on the same activity you started with. Then someone sweeps it and you’re done. The whole thing should be 4–5 minutes.\r\nThis exercises forces you to stop thinking and to start watching and committing. Get out of your head, watch your scene partners, and make decisions as a group. Yes, your decisions will be simple and big, as opposed to specific and personal—but they’ll be fun and bold. Scenes\r\nNext, you do scenes inspired by your sound and movement.\r\nWhen I say “inspired by,” I simply mean you take any one of the big physical activities and start a scene with it. Maybe you start by shooting a basketball. Or maybe you just start with waving your arms up and down in front of you, but you make it that you’re swatting away flies, or something else that could actually happen in the real world.\r\nObviously you won’t be initiating with full ideas, because you’re just starting with a physical motion.\r\nThe interesting side effect of this is that people will play boldly and decisively. People who are normally timid will be brave and confident. People who have never acted will enter a scene with real swagger.\r\nThe sound and movement will have helped everyone get out of their heads. People will jump off the back line to join scenes. People will make decisions confidently and quickly. And yes, the scenes will also be a bit sillier and broader, but it will teach a young group what confidence and physicality feel like.\r\nI don’t recommend this for a show, generally speaking. It’s too abstract and makes things too silly. Having said that, I was on a team that was having trouble getting along and not committing well in our shows. We started doing sound-and-movement openings for our shows, and they got better. Sure, after a short time the openings got too similar, and we had to move on, but for a burst they did help us play together","post_title":"Follow The Follower \/ Sound And Movement","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"follow-the-follower-sound-and-movement","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-12-17 20:25:58","post_modified_gmt":"2018-12-17 20:25:58","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/ccbtse.cliffweb.eu\/?post_type=exercise&#038;p=62","menu_order":"0","post_type":"exercise","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

You have to get over being cool, which is the point.\r\nI recommend this for the last session of an eight-week course, or for teams who are a bit burnt out or in their heads. It is good either at the top of a rehearsal or after a break.<\/span>\r\n<span class=\"fontstyle3\"><strong>DIRECTIONS<\/strong>\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Split up into pairs. If there’s an odd number, the teacher should join a pair.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">PHASE ONE: Compliments\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">When the teacher says go, one person in the pair starts complimenting the other on their improv—what they do, the way they do it, anything.\r\nAt 45 seconds the teacher says “switch,” and now the person who had been getting complimented does the complimenting.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">PHASE TWO: Boasting\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">This is the harder part.\r\nEveryone switches into a new pair. When the teacher says go, one person boasts about their own strengths in improv to the other person. Say what you’re good at. Boast about the version of yourself on a good day; it’s okay if you don’t always do the thing you’re bragging about. The person who’s listening should help by nodding.\r\nThe teacher should tell the class that they are being given permission to boast. Being on stage requires a bit of an ego, so boosting your own before you act is not self-indulgent but necessary.\r\nThe audience, your team, and you all want the confident version of you on stage, so this boasting exercise is actually helpful to everyone. It is also good to practice bolstering your own view of yourself, as a balance against the negative voice that can get into every performer’s head from time to time.\r\nAt 45 seconds, the teacher says “switch,” and the other member of the pair boasts.\r\nIt’s not nearly as hard as it sounds, and everyone leaves the class feeling pretty great.\r\nThis exercise is also good to force wannabe comedians to stop trying to be smarter and funnier than everyone, and to make them be emotionally vulnerable once in a while.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">BACKGROUND\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">I learned this when I took a monologue study workshop in the fall of 2001. I had been put on a house improv team at the Upright Citizens Brigade shortly before this. It was my first time being a regular performer, and I was terrified of not being up to the task, so I started going to an acting class. It was a drop-in monologue study workshop run by a guy named Rob McCaskill, who’d taught an improv course I’d taken a few years before.\r\nDoing “real” acting was extremely frightening. I was a computer programmer, and everyone else in this monologue drop-in class were these very emotive, actorly actors. The first day, I performed the monologue from the end of <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle4\">Cool Hand Luke, <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">feeling silly and scared as I did it.\r\nI liked Rob a lot. He gave generous, pragmatic advice that was easy to do and didn’t make me feel terrible. It ranged from very direct things (“Try a longer pause after each period,” “Pick a specific person you’re addressing”) to more general stuff (“Let this get simpler,” “Do less”). Just the act of going to this course made me feel braver, and the actual advice also improved my performance.\r\nRob would often have us start the workshops with this compliment\/boast exercise. It reminded me that the other actors didn’t see me as someone who wasn’t up to the task, but instead as someone who was being brave and going for it. We were all rooting for each other and focusing on what was working<\/span>\r\n<\/span>","post_title":"Compliment \/ Boast","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"compliment-boast","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2018-12-17 20:29:55","post_modified_gmt":"2018-12-17 20:29:55","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"0","guid":"https:\/\/ccbtse.cliffweb.eu\/?post_type=exercise&#038;p=63","menu_order":"0","post_type":"exercise","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0"},

Whoever initiates must make a big choice. Something unusual, fantastical, or strange. The responder simply has to act exactly as they would in real life.\r\nBeware of people acting unrealistic just to “say yes.” Here’s a scene between improvisers\r\nBrock Bivens and Michael Hanggi.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Brock: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">I gotta tell you something. Last night I was abducted by aliens. It was a classic silver thing like you see in the movies. It pulled me right up into the spaceship from my bed. Performed weird acts on me.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Michael: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle4\">(deeply concerned) <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Oh man, are you… are you okay?\r\nI stopped the scene. That’s not what you would say if a friend told you they were kidnapped by aliens. That’s what’s said by an improviser who is under pressure to “say yes.” But I’m asking for a truthful response.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Brock: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">They took me up there, they laid me on a bed. They performed, like, surgeries on me,  they cut me open. And now I’m here! I just woke up, I was in my bed.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Michael: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Wait a minute. Sit down. <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle4\">(Player A sits.) <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Dude, I’m, like, worried about you, man.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Brock: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">I’M kinda worried about me! It’s like I’m the only one who saw it, so I, like, I feel insane! I saw them! They were grey! They had the big eyes. And they were small! Like this big, and they walked around me, and they poked and they looked, and you’re just like, “What’s going on?” And I was, like, is this how my life ends? IS this life?\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Michael: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Dude, um, maybe we should go, like, talk to a specialist. Someone who can help you with this?\r\nIn this exercise, you can dismiss opinions that people try to pin on you, you can ask questions, you can refuse to believe things, and you can choose not to care! You also do not have to find the initiation unusual if you don’t, like this beginning between Zach Pyke and Sommer\r\nBranham.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Zach<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">: Mom, I’ve decided I’m never going to school again!\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Sommer: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Oh, honey. You’ll learn to like school.\r\nSommer didn’t find it weird for her child to say that, and she reacted naturally. Great! No problem.\r\nA few caveats you’ll have to point out: the responder cannot leave and must engage the <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">person, and you cannot change any facts. If the weird thing is evident, you should believe it, but have a truthful reaction. Here’s one between actors Robert Woo and Brad Cameron.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Robert: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle4\">(shoots gun at player) <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Did that bullet just bounce off of you, man?\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Brad: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Don’t tell anybody!\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Robert: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">What? Stay away from me!\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Brad: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Don’t tell anybody! I come from the planet Nangongongon! I come in peace—don’t tell anyone!\r\nRemember: “Saying yes” to the weird thing is pedaling, and expressing skepticism and “saying no” is like hitting the brakes. True, we need to be pedaling more than braking, but you do need to brake sometimes. Here’s a scene from actors Sommer Branham and Jake Minton.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Sommer: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">So, babe, for dinner tonight, I kinda wanted to change things up. I got a peacock.\r\nAnd will you cut it up for me? I’ll take care of the salad.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Jake: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Babe, where did you get this?\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Sommer: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">The neighbor’s backyard. They have a couple of them. They look like pests. So I thought I was helping them.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Jake: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Babe, we have to put this back.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Sommer<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">: It’s already dead. We’re not putting it back.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Jake: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">I can see that it’s dead. We can just sort of… I mean… I mean it sounds good.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Sommer: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Doesn’t it? Healthy protein.\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Jake: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Yeah. I’m just a little nervous. I mean… you have a peacock recipe? We have chicken in the freezer!\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Sommer: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">I wanted to change things up! And he walked in front of my car. Wait, I’m pretty sure this is a boy, right, because of the long feathers?\r\n<\/span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">Jake: <\/span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">I don’t know! Wait, you ran this thing down with your car?\r\nYou can see in this scene the husband has room to be won over if that’s what the scene needs. But he’s being real. The wife has a reason for her behavior that’s plausible without being so reasonable it kills the fun.\r\nThe actor playing the husband has a good sense of what his character knows: he doesn’t know if it’s a male peacock, but he notices and is alarmed when his wife said she hit it with her car.\r\nThe actors are reliable reporters of what’s going on. They are engaged with the scene and using their own sensibilities. It’s fun!

They react to the freak as if he\/she\/it’s completely normal, totally correct in point of view, and perhaps even the paradigm of how one should act in this world! It is fun to subvert the rules of reality like this. The easiest way to achieve this is to elevate the status of the unusual character.

Coach will provide players with a commonly known (whether through life or media) situations and players will perform an abridged (2-4 minute) version of this situation\/interaction that is not funny or unusual, but as accurate as possible. Encourage players to hit the major Tropes\/Mile Markers\/ Plot Points of these situations. Begin with a greeting and end with a farewell.\r\n\r\nReview the major plot points (likely 5-7 points in the scene). Redo the scene from the very beginning with the same players, only this time allow them to find something unusual\/a game to play. The concession is that they must hit all of those plot points, meaning they can’t get hung up on the first game move. They must leave stuff behind.\r\n\r\nCommon examples:\r\n\r\n• Apple Genius Appointment - Hello, Explanation of Issue, Symptom Questioning, Diagnosis, Prescribed Action\/Resolution, Farewell!\r\n\r\n• Babysitter Parent Rundown - Hello, Explanation of Children, Food Explanation\/ Ask about Allergies, Bedtime\/Brush Teeth, Television, Emergency Contact, Bye!\r\n\r\n• Doctor Checkup - Hello, Checking Chart, Symptom Questioning\/Explanation, Check Vitals, Diagnosis, Prescription, Farewell!\r\n\r\n• Cop Pull Over - License and Registration, Questioning, Explanation of Violation, Running Plates, Resolution, Farewell\r\n\r\nCoach Notes:\r\n\r\n• Discourage players from being too unusual\/interesting in initial scenes. Focus on accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n• In the second scene, if the group has trouble resting the game while moving on, encourage them to “be boring” in between game moves. “Just go back to what you were doing. Be normal. Be boring. You will find an opportunity to play this game again.\"\r\n\r\n• Note that these instances where we return to the base reality allow for the game moves to really stand out.\r\n\r\n• While noting: “We only ever get to (second or third explorative) game move if we leave that first one behind.
