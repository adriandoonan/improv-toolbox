2 up. The players are given a location. Each player has to think of a genuine belief they have. it can be anything that's true, specific and personal is better. Like: "Almost nothing is better than when my cat sits on my lap", "People that play music from their phones out loud should die", "I'm an aspiring vegetarian". They should spend some time doing object work setting up the scene, the first words either player says should be their true statement and that should inform their whole deal. They don't necessarily have to say it again unless it helps nail their deal. they should think - what kind of person would say this, how would they move, talk etc. obviously that player was the originator but they should highten the character way beyond their own persona.

The second part of this is to start with a statement you DON'T believe, again - personal and detailed is better, EG: "I love body contact from strangers" "Manufactured pop music is amazing!" "90 minutes of football isn't enough". This should be even more fun as we can really make fun of the characters.
