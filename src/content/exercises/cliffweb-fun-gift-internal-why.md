  Two people up. Give a suggestion.
  
  First line: give a fun gift to the other character, meaning endow them with having done something strange / interesting / silly / funny.
  
  Second line: Say yes, and give an internal why.
  
  1: I notice you’re flinging soup from a bowl into your garden.
  
  2: I’m stressed.
  
  1: How does flinging soup help with your stress?
  
  2: Gives me a sense of control.
  
  That’s it. Two more up.
  
  Good types of internal reasons: emotions (“I’m happy”), philosophies (“haste makes waste”), twisted logic (“I think eventually, word will get out and people will be impressed”).
