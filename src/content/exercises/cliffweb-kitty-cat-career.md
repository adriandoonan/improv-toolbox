  To the tune of Meaow Mix (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTunhRVyREU) everyone sings Meaow Meaow ending in Kitty-cat career.
  
  Everyone stands in a circle. Somebody goes to the center and behaving as a cat, acts out a job. Everyone in the circle tries to guess what job they have by yelling out "Kitty-catÂ _blank_". Once someone has guessed correctly the person in the middle goes and stands uncomfortably close to them while everyone sings the song again. The person who guessed correctly now goes into the circle. Repeat until everyone has gone.
