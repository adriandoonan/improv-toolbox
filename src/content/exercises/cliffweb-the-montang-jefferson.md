name: "The Montang Jefferson"
purpose: "ObjectWork"
shortDescription: "The purpose of this exercise is to take two entirely different initiations and have them work in one scene."
description: |
  Start with two players back to back without touching each other.
  
  Give the suggestion.
  
  Ask them to go from A to C with the suggestion and start object work.
  
  As soon as you see them doing two unrelated things, have them turn to each other and explain why those two things belong together.
  
  Example:
  
  The suggestion is fruit.
  Player 1 starts drawing a picture.
  Player 2 starts cooking a meal.
  They turn to each other.
  Player 1: Thanks for letting me paint you while you cook, mom.
  Player 2: Sure honey.  I hope this gets you an A in art class.
  
  Players shouldn't abandon what they're doing individually - they should find out why these things are happening at the same time.  They should also help their scene partner by explaining what they are doing so their partner doesn't have to ask.
  
  "Montang Jefferson" was the name of Billy Merritt's college roommate's dog.  It's just two words that don't mean anything together.
  
  The Takeaway
  We can find ways to say yes to things even if they don't seem right at first not to fit together.
