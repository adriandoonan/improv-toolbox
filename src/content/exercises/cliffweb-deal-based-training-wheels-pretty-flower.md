  Round 1
  
  - 2 players up, they start a normal scene with a suggestion. Who what where and all that
  
  - After about 3 lines from each player, the scene is paused
  
  - Each player is asked what their characters "deal" is:
  
  - I think, I feel, I need, I want
  
  - How do you feel about the other player?
  
  - How do you feel about this situation?
  
  - What's a weird fact about yourself?
  
  - Resume the scene, but the characters should now be heightened based on their deal, they must not drop their deal!
  
  Round 2
  
  - Same as above but now the back-line can tag in and create a tag run for one of the characters, heightening their deal
  
  - After a "petal" has been heightened as far as it can go, the tag run is wiped and we go back to the base scene
  
  - One both characters have had a "petal" the scene is wiped completely
focus: "Characters"
