**Round 1**

- 2 players up, they start a normal scene with a suggestion. Who what where and all that
- After about 3 lines from each player, the scene is paused
- Each player is asked what their characters "deal" is:
- I think, I feel, I need, I want
- How do you feel about the other player?
- How do you feel about this situation?
- What's a weird fact about yourself?
- Resume the scene, but the characters should now be heightened based on their deal, they must not drop their deal!

**Round 2**

- Same as above but now the back-line can tag in and create a tag run for one of the characters, heightening their deal
- After a "petal" has been heightened as far as it can go, the tag run is wiped and we go back to the base scene
- One both characters have had a "petal" the scene is wiped completely
