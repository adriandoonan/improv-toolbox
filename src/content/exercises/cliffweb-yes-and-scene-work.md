name: "\"Yes ... And\" scene work"
purpose: "SceneWork"
shortDescription: "One purpose of this exercise is to practice listening in a Long Form scene. You must be listening carefully in this exercise since you will have to repeat what was just said. Repeating the information from the previous line proves that you have been listening. When you add new information in your line, you are showing that you understand your partner's contribution to the scene. Yes And scenes usually feel a little stilted. However, this exercise is essential for getting the behavior of Yes And-ing into your muscle memory. Before things become second nature, we need to practice them consciously. This exercise will make it glaringly obvious whether or not you are listening. This exercise prevents you from skipping this important scene work step."

  - At least three improvisers are needed for this exercise. - Two improvisers
  perform a scene from a single suggestion given by the third. The third
  improviser watches the scene. - One improviser will initiate, or give the first
  line of the scene. - The improvisers will then literally say "Yes ... And" at
  the start of each successive line. The ''Yes And" will come in this form: -
  ''Yes" [repeat the information from the last line] - "And" [add new information
  to the scene] - Statements are necessary for this exercise. - Questions won't
  add new information; they will only force your scene partner to add information.
  Imperatives (e.g., "Come here!") also fail because they often force your sceneâ€¦

- At least three improvisers are needed for this exercise.

- Two improvisers perform a scene from a single suggestion given by the third. The
third improviser watches the scene.

- One improviser will initiate, or give the first line of the scene.

- The improvisers will then literally say "Yes ... And" at the start of each successive line.
The ''Yes And" will come in this form:

- ''Yes" [repeat the information from the last line]

- "And" [add new information to the scene]

- Statements are necessary for this exercise.

- Questions won't add new information; they will only force your scene partner to add information.
Imperatives (e.g., "Come here!") also fail because they often force your scene partner to do something without adding new information about the Who, What, and Where. Statements allow you to more quickly establish a reality and find something unusual to explore in that reality.

- Make sure that your Yes And statements add information to the present moment and the characters in the scene. A void Yes And statements that refer to the past, the future, or characters not in the scene.

- Resist the urge to ''Yes ... But." Someone else in your group should stop the scene every time a scene partner says "But" instead of "And" to give them a chance to deliver a different line without "But." ''Yes ... But" shows a desire to argue instead of building the scene together.
