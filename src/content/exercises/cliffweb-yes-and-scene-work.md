name: '"Yes ... And" scene work'
purpose: Scene Work
shortDescription: Literal “Yes, and” drill where two players build a scene by repeating and adding new information with every line.
description: "Work in trios: one offers a suggestion while the other two play the scene. Each line must start with “Yes” to restate the previous offer and “And” to layer in a new detail, reinforcing additive statements over questions or negations."

- At least three improvisers are needed for this exercise.

- Two improvisers perform a scene from a single suggestion given by the third. The
  third improviser watches the scene.

- One improviser will initiate, or give the first line of the scene.

- The improvisers will then literally say "Yes ... And" at the start of each successive line.
  The ''Yes And" will come in this form:

- ''Yes" [repeat the information from the last line]

- "And" [add new information to the scene]

- Statements are necessary for this exercise.

- Questions won't add new information; they will only force your scene partner to add information.
  Imperatives (e.g., "Come here!") also fail because they often force your scene partner to do something without adding new information about the Who, What, and Where. Statements allow you to more quickly establish a reality and find something unusual to explore in that reality.

- Make sure that your Yes And statements add information to the present moment and the characters in the scene. A void Yes And statements that refer to the past, the future, or characters not in the scene.

- Resist the urge to ''Yes ... But." Someone else in your group should stop the scene every time a scene partner says "But" instead of "And" to give them a chance to deliver a different line without "But." ''Yes ... But" shows a desire to argue instead of building the scene together.
