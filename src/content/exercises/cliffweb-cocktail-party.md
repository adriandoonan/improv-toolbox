- The participating improvisers split into groups of three and then spread out. Another improviser acts as a "conductor."
- Each group is assigned a number.
- Each group of improvisers should commit physically to the idea that they are different parts of the same cocktail party.
- All three groups are given the same suggestion to inspire three different conversations. For example, if the suggestion was "gun," one group may talk about gun control, another group may talk about Guns N' Roses, and the third group may talk about video games.
- The conductor calls out the number of the group that will have focus.
- While one group is speaking, the others should mime a conversation while listening to what is being said.
- When the conductor calls out a new number, the previous group gives focus by stopping their conversation. The new group takes focus by starting or resuming their conversation.
- After a few rounds of calling out numbers, the conductor falls away and .the three groups begin giving and taking focus on their own. The improvisers should look for natural pauses in conversation and take focus by loudly and clearly restarting their conversation.
- Each group should take the passage of time into consideration as they return to their conversation. You are not "pausing'' your conversation and picking it up exactly where you left off; it shouldÂ be assumed that your characters have been talking while you have been miming and the other group has had the focus in the scene.

**VARIATION**

- Use the same basic setup, but this time each group should listen carefully to the group currently speaking.
- After each group has had at least two opportunities to speak, you should look for ways to make
  connections between your conversation and the other conversations happening.
- When your group retakes focus, try to incorporate specifics, details, ideas, and themes that you heard mentioned by the other groups
