- Six to eight improvisers take the stage.

- Someone else in the group offers a one-word suggestion to inspire any two improvisers on the stage. The rest of the improvisers will stand against the wall behind these two improvisers. This is referred to as the back-line.

- Two improvisers will begin a scene, looking to clearly establish a reality containing a Who, What, and Where.

- The improvisers should continue to Yes And each other and get more specific until they discover the first unusual thing.

- Once the two improvisers performing the scene find the Game, one of the players on the back-line should tag out either improviser by tapping them on the shoulder. When an improviser is tagged out, they are taken out of the scene and replaced by the improviser that did the tagging. The person who has been tagged out will then join the back-line.

- Usually, an improviser tagging into a scene will play a new character. For this exercise, the improviser that tags in will take over the character that has already been established. In other words, the scene should continue exactly where it left off, with the same two characters and the same Game.

- Once the first tag-out happens, the rest of the improvisers on the back-line may begin to tag into the scene. Either character can be tagged out and taken over as long as the new improviser enters? play the same Game by asking, "If this unusual thing is true, then what else is true?"

- Afterward, discuss as a group which moves were in keeping with the Game and which moves didn't work.
