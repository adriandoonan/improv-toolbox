This is an exercise that is simple to explain, though a bit tricky to do.

> Do scenes where the goal is to blow the audience away.

In the spirit of the roulette example, do a series of scenes where you are trying to blow the audience away with how far things go.
Make more interesting choices with greater commitment than you normally think you’re allowed to. Feel your power. (Don’t be physically intrusive.)
Sometimes it’s good to have an exercise that is simply a big challenge. Rather than a strict structure, it’s on you to make this happen. Find a way to blow the audience away. You’ll have to get creative. You might want to start slowly, giving yourself room to find new possibilities.
