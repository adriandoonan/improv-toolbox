This is an exercise in taking a situation that seems impossible and making it seem plausible.
Two people up. One says to the other, “So, how did you get to be a [blank]?” where [blank] is any job: auto mechanic, deep sea diver, veterinarian, anything—but preferably something far away from what the person being asked really is.
The person then explains how they got that job, but the trick is to use as much of their real life as they can. Use real details from your life until you have to start branching off into an alternate life where you got this supposed job.
Let’s say it’s, “So how did you get to be a mailman?” You can’t just say, “I graduated from college, and then I realized I loved the mail and so I became a mailman!” No, that’s not how people get jobs, generally.
Take a moment and think about what could have really happened to make you a mailman.
Mine would be this: “I graduated from college as a journalism major (true), but when I graduated the economy was terrible and there were no good jobs in almost any field (true). My friends and I were sitting around and someone pointed out that a job in civil service would be nice because it’s so structured (not true, but could have happened). Pay raises are small, but kind of guaranteed if you do anything close to a decent job. And there’s good benefits. So, even though it seemed ‘beneath’ a college graduate, I applied for a job and I got it (not true, but doesn’t sound insane). Then I started getting promotions. I’m really organized (true) and I kinda like losing myself in fixed tasks (true).”
Then end it with the person who just described how they became a [blank] giving a surprising where for the scene. After explaining how you became a mailman, say, “Anyway, I’m here to get my car washed.” That’s just for fun and does not contribute to anything
