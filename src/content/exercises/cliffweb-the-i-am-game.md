- Half of the group will take the stage and the other half of the group will act as an audience.

- One member of the ensemble steps off of the backline and directly addresses the audience.

- This improviser makes a statement in the following format: "I am \_ ." This blank is filled in with an inanimate object.

- After this improviser declares their object, they should take a few lines to describe the object's actions, thoughts, feelings, beliefs, or opinions.

- The improviser embodies the object both verbally and physically.

- A second improviser will then step out to play a different inanimate object, adhering to the same "I am \_\_" format, followed by a few lines of further description
  The second improviser will be looking to establish a pattern of some sort.

- A third improviser will step out to play a different inanimate object, speaking in the "I am \_\_" format once again
  This third improviser will follow the pattern established by the second If they do so, the pattern begun by the second improviser will be locked.

- Once the other improvisers on the backline have established each of their inanimate objects, the ensemble will continue to describe their inanimate objects, adhering to the pattern that has been established.

**EXAMPLE**

- PLAYER 1: "I am a Hershey's chocolate bar I'm the best candy bar because I'm a classic I'm old-school."

- (PLAYER 2 finds it interesting that the Hershey bar is bragging about being the best He establishes a pattern by playing another candy bar that is also bragging.)

- PLAYER 2: "I'm a Baby Ruth I'm so good, they named me after the greatest baseball player who ever lived."

- (PLAYER 3 recognizes the pattern of bragging and locks it with the following move.)

- PLAYER 3: "I'm a Whatchamacallit I'm so indescribably good that people can't even give me a name."

- (The ensemble continues this pattern until every member has Added On as another candy bar making a case for its superiority The ensemble members then continue to make their cases for superiority through give-and-take.)
