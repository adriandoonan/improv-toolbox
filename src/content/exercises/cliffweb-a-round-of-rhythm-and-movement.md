shortDescription: "To losen everybody up physically and vocally"
description: "Everyone stands in a circle. One person gets into the middle and starts making sounds and movements. Encourage people to be wild and go beyond their basic comfort zone, to explore different parts of their bodies and voices. Everyone on the outside of the circle copies the person in the center, exactly. The focus should be on the specific movements and sounds the person in the center is making. Once they feel like they've moved enough they approach a person in the circle who takes over their spot. Keep going until everyone has gone."

Everyone stands in a circle. One person gets into the middle and starts making sounds and movements.

Encourage people to be wild and go beyond their basic comfort zone, to explore different parts of their bodies and voices.

Everyone on the outside of the circle copies the person in the center, exactly.

The focus should be on the specific movements and sounds the person in the center is making.

Once they feel like they've moved enough they approach a person in the circle who takes over their spot. Keep going until everyone has gone.
