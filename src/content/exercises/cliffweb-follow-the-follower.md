description: This is a good way to practice getting in sync with other improvisers when using sound and movement to generate information. Sound and movement will be used in this way to generate information in an Organic Opening. Note that this exercise can also serve as a good warm-up for improvisation since it allows you to practice, in an abstract sense. what we arc trying to do in organic Long Form scenes (start from nothing and find interesting ideas to explore).

- A group of improvisers forms a circle.
- The improvisers will adopt a neutral position (e.g., head facing forward, feet shoulder-width apart, arms hanging by their sides, etc.).
- The objective is to remain neutral, but not frozen. In other words, no one consciously initiates any movements or "leads."
- The improvisers will scan the circle and should look to mirror any slight movements or facial expressions that they see. This could be something as simple as the twitching of an arm or the subtle shift in weight from one foot to another.
- Once two or more people are mirroring each other, the rest of the group must join in. At this point, a small sound that complements the movement will be added by someone in the group.
- The entire group must then mirror this sound. From this point on, every repetition of movement and vocalization must be heightened from the last.
- Continue this heightening process until you can't possibly go any further, and the sound and movement necessarily transforms into something else. It's important to note that again, there is no leader. No one is consciously transforming;
  that will happen as a product of heightening.After about three or more transformations, look to end the exercise at a heightened moment.

**ALTERNATE INSTRUCTIONS**

- A group of improvisers forms a circle.
- Someone outside of the circle gives them a suggestion.
- This suggestion is used to inspire a specific sound and movement. This means rather than starting from neutral, you are starting with a choice. One person initiates with this choice, which everyone else then mirrors.
  The group then heightens and transforms this sound and movement in the same fashion described above.
