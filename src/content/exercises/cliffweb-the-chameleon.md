- Six to eight improvisers get onstage and form a back-line.

- One improviser will step forward and volunteer to be "the chameleon" in three to four quick scenes. The chameleon will remain center stage as three to four improvisers step forward, one after another, to initiate scenes.
Without getting suggestions, each of these improvisers will step out from the back-line and initiate a scene with a strong character choice. The chameleon should then match that character, and they will perform a short scene.

- Matching means that you play the same type of character by taking on the same energy, beliefs, likes, dislikes, physicality, etc. The chameleon shouldn't repeat their scene partner's lines; they just need to match the character choice.

- After the first chameleon has matched three to four characters, they should step to the back-line, allowing another improviser to step forward to become the next chameleon.

- As the improviser coming from the back-line with a character, do not initiate any of these scenes with a line that makes it difficult for the chameleon to match you. (Example: An improviser steps out playing an incredibly old woman and says, "Young man, it is so kind of you to come visit me." It will be difficult for the scene partner to match this choice since they have been set up to portray a young man.)
