Everyone in a circle. The teacher picks someone to start. That person walks across the circle and speaks as a character for a line or two.

Perhaps they adopt the tone of an elderly, crotchety man, and say, “Well, look who’s playing in my yard! The Spencer boy!”
Whoever is being spoken to responds as the same kind of character. Same voice, same philosophy. Even in this case, when it has been established that the person being spoken to is a little boy, the little boy responds in the same voice and philosophy.

“That’s me! What a troublemaker I am! And I’m gonna mess up your lawn good!” The initiator responds, making this a three-line scene: “You better not!”

Then the person who crossed the circle takes the responder’s spot, and the responder walks across the circle and speaks as a brand-new character to someone else.
