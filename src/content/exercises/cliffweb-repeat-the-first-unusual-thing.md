- Have two improvisers take the stage. Give them a one-word suggestion. The improvisers will begin a scene, looking to clearly establish a reality containing a Who, What, and Where. The improvisers should continue to Yes And each other until they discover the first unusual thing. When either improviser feels that their scene partner may have introduced the first unusual thing into their scene, they should repeat the line containing this information back to their scene partner word for word. This is not done in character. This is the improviser repeating, word for word, what the other improviser has said.

- The improviser who said the first unusual thing should repeat the line again. The improviser who identified the first unusual thing will repeat the line for a second time. The improviser who originally said the first unusual thing will repeat the line once more. (The same line should be heard fours times in total.)

- The scene should then continue forward from this point. Now that the first unusual thing has been clearly identified, the improvisers can react to it, Establishing a pattern that will set the Game in motion. Both improvisers are responsible for making clear choices with regard to how they are reacting or responding to what has been identified as the first unusual thing.
