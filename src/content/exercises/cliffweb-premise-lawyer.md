- A group of at least three improvisers takes the stage and form a circle.

- One improviser steps into the circle to play the Premise Lawyer.

- Improvisers standing on the circle will raise their hands when they have a premise in mind.

- The premise lawyer will call on an improviser to hear their premise.

Note: The premise should be absurd so that it challenges the Premise Lawyer to defend it. For example, "I want my employees to double their productivity'" isn't a premise, because wanting employees to increase productivity is not an unusual thing. A similar premise that would work might be,
"I want my employees to work a 22-hour workday in order to double their productivity." The Premise Lawyer will then offer an exploration move that supplies a "why" for the absurd or unusual behavior or idea central to the premise.

**EXAMPLES:**

- Premise: "I don't think people should drink water." Possible Exploration Move: "I'm really into conservation, so I think people are just wasting water every time they drink it.";

- Premise: "Reading should not be taught in schools." Possible Exploration Move: "If we teach the children to read, they will eventually overthrow adults and ass~me control of the world.";

- Premise: "I think bald women are more attractive." Possible Exploration Move: "Hair tends to get everywhere. I find bald women to be more hygienic."

**VARIATIONS**

There is never only one correct way to justify a premise. To prove this and get more of your group involved, stand in a line. One member of your group will offer a premise. Go down the line until every other member has offered a different exploration move that justifies the premise. This version forces you to think creatively as the more "obvious" justifications are taken. The Premise Lawyer can offer his or her exploration move in character through a line of dialogue. After the Premise Lawyer has had a chance to defend a premise, the rest of the group can get involved and offer some exploration moves
