Circle up!
players point at someone in the circle and say their own name, the subject says "yes". Then and only then the players change places. The subject does the same. This should get to a nice rhythm where people are changing places all the time.
**Variation**
Play it like "Where the fuck is the celery". A player points at a player and says their own name, then that player to another player and so on until everyone is pointing at someone and is being pointed at. Then everyone keep looping around doing this for a while using the same pattern.
- Now play version 1 but you say the other persons name and not your own, you'll be surprised how many you can remember!
