name: "Recognizing the first unusual thing"
purpose: "Game"
shortDescription: "This exercise will help you to develop the skill of recognizing the first unusual thing. New improvisers often have so much to think about during a scene that recognizing the first unusual thing is lost. By watching the scene from the outside, you can focus solely on the first unusual thing. This is an important part of your development as an improviser. It is like a basketball player practicing jump shots outside of game conditions. For the improvisers in the scene, the benefit of this exercise is to get practice playing the Game of the scene from the point of the first unusual thing without having to recognize it on their own. This exercise is more akin to T-ball, in which young baseball players are given the experience of hitting a baseball without having to wait for the right pitch."

  Two improvisers take the stage.
  
  Give them a one-word suggestion.
  
  The improvisers will begin a scene, looking to clearly establish a reality containing a Who, What, and Where. The improvisers should continue to Yes And each other until they discover the first unusual thing.
  
  The rest of your group should watch the scene carefully for the first unusual thing. Any of the improvisers watching should raise their hand when they think they see the first unusual thing. They should be looking for something that is unusual given the reality that has been established.
  
  Stop the scene when the first hand is raised. This person should explain what they saw as the first unusual thing. Discuss this first unusual thing as a group. It is okay to disagree about what is unusual-some people will see things that others will miss.
  
  Either have the improvisers resume the scene with the identified first unusual thing in mind or discuss potential Game moves as a group. Throw out different Game moves that could spring off of that first unusual thing
