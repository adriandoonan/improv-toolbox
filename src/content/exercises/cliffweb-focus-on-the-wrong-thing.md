  2 up.
  
  One initiates that an unfortunate thing has happened.
  (example from Will Hines)
  
  Player 1: “My dog just died.”
  
  Player 2: “Oh my God, where?”
  
  That’s from Suzi Barrett, describing a scene with Rebecca Drysdale.
  
  It really works when there’s a thing we EXPECT you to care about.
  
  Player 1: “I’ve been shot!”
  
  Player 2: “I’ll call an ambulance!”
  
  Player 1: “No! No! Take a picture! My brother has always called me soft! This will prove him I’m tough!”
  
  The second player deliberately focuses on the wrong thing as above. Player 1 plays the straight character, Hilarity ensues!
