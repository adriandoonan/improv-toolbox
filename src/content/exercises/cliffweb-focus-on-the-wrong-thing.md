2 up.

One initiates that an unfortunate thing has happened.
(example from Will Hines)

Player 1: “My dog just died.”

Player 2: “Oh my God, where?”

That’s from Suzi Barrett, describing a scene with Rebecca Drysdale.

It really works when there’s a thing we EXPECT you to care about.

Player 1: “I’ve been shot!”

Player 2: “I’ll call an ambulance!”

Player 1: “No! No! Take a picture! My brother has always called me soft! This will prove him I’m tough!”

The second player deliberately focuses on the wrong thing as above. Player 1 plays the straight character, Hilarity ensues!
