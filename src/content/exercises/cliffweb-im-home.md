This exercise is for duos.

Stand around six feet apart, facing each other. Player A mimes opening a door, in character, and declares "Im home". The character should be grounded; if you've initiated a nervous character, they should be realistically nervous, at around a 5 out of 10.

Now switch places, and Player B opens the door and says "I'm home" as the same character, but heightened slightly to a 6. Repeat, heightening gradually, until you cannot get any more ridiculous.

A nervous character heightened to a 10 should be barely able to grip the door handle properly, and have to drag themselves into the room, trembling as they do so. Give yourself permission to ham it up to a ridiculous degree!

Now start again with a totally different character.
