name: "The Ad Game"
purpose: "GroupGame"
shortDescription: "This exercise will force your ensemble to practice performing Verbal, All At Once Group Games. This exercise will help you strengthen your ability to listen, Yes And, and utilize give-and-take."
description: |
  - Four or more members of the ensemble take the stage.
  
  - Another member of the ensemble comes up with an unusual product by taking an ordinary item and giving it an unusual trait (e.g., a car that changes color based on its surroundings, or a refrigerator that is also a radio).
  
  - The ensemble will work together to create an advertising campaign for this product.
  They will work together to come up with a name for the product, a slogan, a target demographic, a celebrity spokesperson, a jingle, etc. All elements of the campaign should complement each other. For example, if Player 1 says, "We could call it 'The Chameleon,"' then Player 2 could say, "Yeah! We could have Meryl Streep be the spokesperson. She could talk about how she disappears into her roles just like this car disappears into its surroundings."
  No matter what idea is thrown out, the entire group must support and Yes And it.
  
  Now let's look at an example of a full improvised ad campaign for the car that changes color based on its surroundings:
  
  - PLAYER 1: "We could call it 'The Chameleon."'
  
  - PLAYER 2: ''Yeah! We could have Meryl Streep be the spokesperson. She could talk about how she disappears into her roles just like this car disappears into its surroundings."
  
  - PLAYER 3: ''Yeah, she could start off the commercial as Julia Child and then finish the spot as Margaret Thatcher."
  
  - PLAYER 4: "We could sell it to criminals. If the police are chasing them, they can blend into their surroundings and hide."
  
  - PLAYER 3: "We could take helicopter footage of a police chase and suddenly, the car disappears, blending into the highway!"
  
  - PLAYER 2: ''When you don't want to be seen, this is your machine."
  
  - PLAYER 4: "Great slogan. [Singing] 'This car's named after a lizard that can hide, buy this car and camouflage your ride."'
