name: "Someone ate my chocolate bunny!"
purpose: "WarmUp"
shortDescription: "Students stand in a circle, one says with an obvious emotion \"Someone ate my chocolate bunny!\" the whole groups responds, mimicking the emotion \"I don't think that's very funny!\". And it goes around the circle. The idea is everyone tries to come up with a fresh emotion or attitude."
