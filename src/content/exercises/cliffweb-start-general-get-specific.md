shortDescription: "START GENERAL, GET SPECIFIC Another way to relate to a scene is to start with the most general version of the character, and then mix in more and more of your real self as you go. This makes the character more specific and also makes it easier to perform. For example, someone starts a scene by accusing you of being a bad husband who stays at work too late. Start by saying the things we expect someone in that position to say. \u201cC\u2019mon, honey, you\u2019re being too sensitive,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just overwhelmed at work right now. We have a big project.\u201d Then make it personal to you. Why are you late for things? What is it about you that makes you stay at something too long when you know there\u2019s someone waiting for you? \u201cI overschedule myself. I just want to please everybody.\u201d Or: \u201cI guess I just think it\u2019s not that big a deal to be half an hour late. It\u2019s just\u2026 not that big a deal.\u201d Or: \u201cI feel good at work. I feel comfortable there. I\u2019m the big king shit there, and I like it there.\u201d Take it from your real life. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019ve never been married, or even if you\u2019ve never had a day job.

  START GENERAL, GET SPECIFIC
  Another way to relate to a scene is to start with the most general version of the character, and then mix in more and more of your real self as you go. This makes the character more specific and also makes it easier to perform.
  For example, someone starts a scene by accusing you of being a bad husband who stays at work too late. Start by saying the things we expect someone in that position to say. “C’mon, honey, you’re being too sensitive,” or “I’m just overwhelmed at work right now. We have a big project.”
  Then make it personal to you. Why are you late for things? What is it about you that makes you stay at something too long when you know there’s someone waiting for you? “I overschedule myself. I just want to please everybody.” Or: “I guess I just think it’s not that big a deal to be half an hour late. It’s just… not that big a deal.” Or: “I feel good at work. I feel comfortable there. I’m the big king shit there, and I like it there.” Take it from your real life.
  It doesn’t matter if you’ve never been married, or even if you’ve never had a day job. The general situation is one you’ve been in, so you can relate to it and mix in your real self
