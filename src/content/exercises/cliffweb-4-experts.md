4 Players up in 4 chairs. The audience suggests some  interesting areas of expertise for the players one by one, such as Quiches, Flat earth theory, The Church of Harry Potter.

The players are now instructed to stand up and do a small “character walk” and the teacher will instruct “How do you walk? Hold yourself? How do you look? How old are you? What are your likes/dislikes?”

Now they sit back down and the audience will ask questions to the experts, it’s best if they’re not tailored to any of the experts specialities. The idea is that the experts should answer through the funnel of their area of expertise. EG if the question was “How can I ask my girlfriend to marry me” The quiche expert might say “Why bake the ring in to a nice Quiche Lorraine” and the flat earther might say “Book a nice holiday and surprise them there, but somewhere not to far, obviously - you wouldn’t want to fall off the edge”

The players should rotate out until everyone has had a go.
