shortDescription: "Do two-person scenes in which each character makes a confession to the other one at some point. \u201cI have something to admit to you.\u201d That kind of confession. Confessions are a good way to jump-start a stalled scene, because they make you say something personal, honest, and important. They also tend to make the scene very much about the characters in it. Here\u2019s a scene between Lisa Timmons and Raymond Lew. Ray: I\u2019ve been working so much on a PowerPoint presentation for Nathan. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s just insane. Lisa: That\u2019s why you\u2019ve been too busy for everything else? (She gestures at their chess board.) This \u201cNathan,\u201d he rules you. Ray: He\u2019s the CEO of the company! I\u2019m taking time out of my day to meet you here in Palisades Park, all right? I expect a little more compassion. Lisa: All right. Ray: Seems like you don\u2019t even want to play now. Lisa: I\u2019m letting you win! Ray: I appreciate that, but... well, I would feel better if I didn\u2019t feel obligated to play chess. The scene needs a boost. A confession from Lisa rights the ship. Lisa: I have a confession to make. This Nathan? I hired him. To distract you from your game. There\u2019s a big laugh, and Ray suddenly has a lot to unpack. Ray: No! He has a corner office! He\u2019s been on CNN, talking to Mad Money! How can you\u2026 just... make him up? Lisa: I am very rich. The confession focused the scene to be about the characters we are watching"

  “I have something to admit to you.” That kind of confession. Confessions are a good way to jump-start a stalled scene, because they make you say something personal, honest, and important.
  They also tend to make the scene very much about the characters in it.
  Here’s a scene between Lisa Timmons and Raymond Lew.
  Ray: I’ve been working so much on a PowerPoint presentation for Nathan. It’s… it’s just insane.
  Lisa: That’s why you’ve been too busy for everything else? (She gestures at their chess board.) This “Nathan,” he rules you.
  Ray: He’s the CEO of the company! I’m taking time out of my day to meet you here in
  Palisades Park, all right? I expect a little more compassion.
  Lisa: All right.
  Ray: Seems like you don’t even want to play now.
  Lisa: I’m letting you win!
  Ray: I appreciate that, but... well, I would feel better if I didn’t feel obligated to play chess.
  The scene needs a boost. A confession from Lisa rights the ship.
  Lisa: I have a confession to make. This Nathan? I hired him. To distract you from your game.
  There’s a big laugh, and Ray suddenly has a lot to unpack.
  Ray: No! He has a corner office! He’s been on CNN, talking to Mad Money! How can you…
  just... make him up?
  Lisa: I am very rich.
  The confession focused the scene to be about the characters we are watching
