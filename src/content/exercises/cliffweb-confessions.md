Do two-person scenes in which each character makes a confession to the other one at some point.
“I have something to admit to you.” That kind of confession. Confessions are a good way to jump-start a stalled scene, because they make you say something personal, honest, and important.
They also tend to make the scene very much about the characters in it.
Here’s a scene between Lisa Timmons and Raymond Lew.

> Ray: I’ve been working so much on a PowerPoint presentation for Nathan. It’s… it’s just insane.
> Lisa: That’s why you’ve been too busy for everything else? (She gestures at their chess board.) This “Nathan,” he rules you.
> Ray: He’s the CEO of the company! I’m taking time out of my day to meet you here in
> Palisades Park, all right? I expect a little more compassion.
> Lisa: All right.
> Ray: Seems like you don’t even want to play now.
> Lisa: I’m letting you win!
> Ray: I appreciate that, but... well, I would feel better if I didn’t feel obligated to play chess.
> The scene needs a boost. A confession from Lisa rights the ship.
> Lisa: I have a confession to make. This Nathan? I hired him. To distract you from your game.
> There’s a big laugh, and Ray suddenly has a lot to unpack.
> Ray: No! He has a corner office! He’s been on CNN, talking to Mad Money! How can you…
> just... make him up?
> Lisa: I am very rich.

The confession focused the scene to be about the characters we are watching
