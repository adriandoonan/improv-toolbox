name: "Character Tagline"
purpose: "Characters"
shortDescription: "Exploring different characters"
description: "Prepare strips of paper. Ask everyone to write a tagline that describes a character on it. These can be varied from \"I love god\" to \"Let's dance\" to \"I eat donuts\". Fold these up and put them in a pile. One person will go up and pick up a paper that is not the one that they wrote. They have to then develop a character based on that tagline without ever saying it. Somebody who is not playing the character comes out and initiates a scene. The person who is developing the character should focus on that. Keep going until everyone has had a chance to develop a character."
