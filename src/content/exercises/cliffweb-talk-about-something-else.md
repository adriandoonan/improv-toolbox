purpose: "ActiveScenes"
shortDescription: "In real life, you are usually doing one thing and talking about another. For example, if you're folding laundry, you are most likely not talking about folding laundry. This exercise will help you to better mirror this reality of life in your scenes."
description: |
  Two improvisers take the stage.
  One improviser will initiate with some sort of physical activity that caP. be done continuously throughout the scene (sorting mail, washing dishes, having dinner, playing golf, setting up a campsite, etc.).
  
  - The other improviser should immediately join in with this activity.
  
  - When either improviser starts speaking, they must talk about something other than what they are doing.
