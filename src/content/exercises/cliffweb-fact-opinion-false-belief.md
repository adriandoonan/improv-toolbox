Going around in a circle and stating facts (best if facts that are personal to you i.e. “I am a man/woman,” “I am blank years old.” Then change statements to opinions you really hold i.e. “I like to eat pasta,” etc. Then change to beliefs or opinions that you don’t actually believe, but you state them with just as much as sincerity as true opinions i.e. “I think murder is ok if you are really pissed off,” etc.
The real, full version of this exercise can be built up to a point where the performers continually walk around the room, speak in any order and the instructor can change the category between fact, opinion and false belief at any time
