4 people up in chairs.
The audience suggests an area of expertise for each player.
Each player recaps.
Now the players get up and walk around an discover a character. They should decide internally though walking and how they hold themselves (see Character Walk) their likes/dislikes/how old they are etc.
The player now sit back down, the instructor should give them a brief interview one by one asking their name & how they got in to their are of expertese. Now the audience can ask any questions they like to any of the experts. The questions don't necessarily have to be about their are of expertise in fact its best if it isn't. The idea is for the players to filter any replies through "their deal"
End by the instructor asking for one last piece of advice.
