name: "The T-Shirt Game"
purpose: "WarmUp"
shortDescription: "Getting out of your head, thinking on your feet and trusting what your brain comes up with in the moment is probably pretty funny."
description: |
  One student describes a fantasy T-Shirt the other student is wearing creatively with detail. When they're done they say "and the caption says:" and the other player without thinking has to sum up the T-Shirt in a caption.
  
  Example:
  A: Your T-Shirt is blue with original Star Trek Enterprise on it and there's flowers coming out of the engines and there's a planet with a smiley face on it... And the caption says:
  B: Where no hippy has gone before
