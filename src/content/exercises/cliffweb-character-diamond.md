shortDescription: "4 players up. Players stand in a diamond formation on the stage. The first person (front) will present a physicality of a character, they will present it to the audience and players, the diamond rotates. The second person presents a voice for the character. (present, rotate for all) The third person presents a quirk (like kicking a leg, or a saying or anything) The 4th person, using all the attributes from the other players now becomes that character and does a short monologue. The teacher should now interview the person asking their name, did anything bad/good happen today, what their job is, do you have anyone special in your life, words of advice etc. Now that person presents a new physicality and the game starts again until everyone has done a monologue."
