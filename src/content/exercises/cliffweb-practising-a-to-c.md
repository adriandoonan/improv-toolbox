- A group of improvisers stands in a circle.

- One improviser begins the exercise by saying an idea followed by the letter "A."

- The improviser to their right goes through the process of A to C in their head. This improviser then says their C idea aloud, followed by the letter "C."

- The person to their right provides the new A word by guessing what the previous person's B idea might have been. Once they have a guess, this improviser says it aloud, followed by the letter "A."

- The person to their right uses the A to C process and says their C word idea aloud, followed by the letter "C."

- The exercise continues around the circle in this manner.

**EXAMPLE**

Improviser 1 says, "Dresser, A."

Improviser 2 says, "Soccer, C."

Improviser 3 guesses that Improviser 2's B was "shorts" and says, "Shorts, A."

Improviser 4 says, "Beach, C."

Improviser 5 guesses that the B was "summer" and says, "Summer, A."

_Note: It doesn't matter if you correctly guess what the improviser's B is. For example, Improviser 2 may have thought, Dresser, A, Socks, B, Soccer, C. It is fine for Improviser S to come up with "shorts."_
