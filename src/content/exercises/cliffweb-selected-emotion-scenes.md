name: "Selected Emotion Scenes"
purpose: "SelectedEmotionScenes"
shortDescription: "\u2022 Highlight the importance of reacting emotionally. \u2022 Encourage players to recognize emotional triggers and activate them."
description: |
  Mechanics:
  2-Person Scenes. Suggestion provided. All players select emotion before entering scenes. Player 1 initiates normally. Player 2 responds with a pre-selected emotion, no matter if it would make sense in regard to the initiation. Player 2 starts at emotional volume of 5 and takes it to 10 by the end of the scene. Player 1 tries to activate and push the emotional response further. Repeat until every player has had a chance to respond emotionally.
  
  Coach Note:
  Allow the players to take the emotional response one step further than they thought they had to. Keep scenes relatively short so everyone has a chance to participate.
  
  Note: the easiest way to heighten is emotionally through our reactions.
