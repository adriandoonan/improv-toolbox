Three or more improvisers stand in a line.

- Another improviser will stand in front of them and act as the "conductor" for a story that they will tell together.
- The conductor points at an improviser who begins telling a story.
- The conductor will then randomly point at a different improviser. The improviser currently speaking will abruptly stop telling the story. Then, the new improviser being pointed at will pick up telling the story at the exact moment where the previous improviser left off. The same rule will apply each time the conductor points to a new improviser.
- The conductor can point to a new improviser at any time.
- Caution: Don't try to be funny. Don't try to add absurd twists for laughs. Your only goal is to tell a simple story with a clear plot and consistent tone throughout, as if written by a single author.
