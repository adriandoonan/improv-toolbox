name: "Identifying information from the opening"
purpose: "Game"
shortDescription: "This exercise will help you get better at initiating. If your teammates had trouble identifying the inspiration for your initiation. maybe you weren't \"nailing it over the head\" as hard as you thought you were. This is a great opportunity to practice initiating with each type of information generated from an opening. You will also get better at recognizing the difference between premises, half ideas, and chaff in initiations. Getting better at making this distinction will improve your ability to respond effectively and efficiently in scenes."

  - This exercise requires at least three improvisers. One improviser will tell a monologue inspired by a one-word suggestion. A second improviser will then offer a single line initiation inspired by the monologue. The third improviser (or any other improviser in the group) will then guess what part of the monologue the initiation is coming from.
  
  - The improviser initiating will confirm whether or not the correct section of the monologue was identified. Switch roles and repeat. You can also try a version of this exercise where you guess whether the initiation was using a premise, half idea. or chaff.
