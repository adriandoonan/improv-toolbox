One improviser will, in silence, make a choice that establishes one of the following aspects of the character of the space: activity (playing pool, fishing, stretching, etc.), location (automobile, prison cell, supermarket, etc.), or environmental condition (zero gravity, hot/cold, bright lights, etc.). A second improviser will join the scene and nonverbally agree with the choice that has been made.
