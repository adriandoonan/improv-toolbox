One improviser will, in silence, make a choice that establishes one of the following aspects of the character of the space: activity (playing pool, fishing, stretching, etc.), location (automobile, prison cell, supermarket, etc.), or environmental condition (zero gravity, hot/cold, bright lights, etc.). A second improviser will join the scene and nonverbally agree with the choice that has been made.

**Example: Activity**
Player 1 steps out into the scene and begins folding laundry.
Player 2 joins in by putting dirty laundry into a washing machine.

**Example: Location**
Player 1 steps out and mimes holding onto prison cell bars.
Player 2 stands next to him and holds out a mirror
to see down the row of cells.

**Example: Environmental Condition**
Player 1 steps out squinting with his hand in front of his face.
Player 2 simply mirrors this behavior.
