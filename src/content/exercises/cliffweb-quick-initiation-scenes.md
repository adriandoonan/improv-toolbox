name: "Quick initiation scenes"
purpose: "ActiveScenes"
shortDescription: "Students should learn to have no fear initiation a scene and you don't need to have a clever premise"
description: |
  All players form a backline. Any 2 pairs can come out and initiate with strong character choices, no suggestion and just play!  30 seconds - 1 minute. Either a new pair can come out to edit or the instructor says edit.
  
  The idea is to get people to do fast initiations, no hesitation and find a deal right away. The only instruction is to have a strong character choice and hold on to it. No need to try and be funny or find a game.
  In the early stages of this the scenes can be paused at any time for the instructor to ask “What’s your deal?” - this will hopefully become less necessary
