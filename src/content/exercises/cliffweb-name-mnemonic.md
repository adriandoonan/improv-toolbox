shortDescription: "Name game for the whole group. Each student comes up with a mnemonic and action for their name, EG \"Silly Sara!\" (waggle fingers). Now the whole group repeats and so on around the circle. When everyone's done, students can randomly do another students name + action and that passes the ball to that student and so on."
