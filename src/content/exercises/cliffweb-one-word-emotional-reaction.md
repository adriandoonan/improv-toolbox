Two players up, one word suggestion. Each player states their instant, gut reaction to that suggestion in one word. For example, if the suggestion is "techno", one player's reaction might be "joy" and the other's "irritation".

Avoid passive emotions like "boredom" and "apathy", as these don't constitute strong choices, and are tough to play. Instead, heighten these choices. So "boredom" could become "anger" and "apathy" could become "exasperation".

Now play a short scene where each player can only say their one word for the whole scene. Ideally, the scene should not be about the suggestion - so in this example it shouldn't take place in a techno club or in a record shop. The teacher/coach should edit the scene when it reaches an emotional peak.
