name: Three-line scenes
purpose: SceneWork
shortDescription: Rotate fast three-line scenes to drill initiations, responses, and quick commitments.
description: Form two single-file lines facing each other. The initiator delivers the first line from a suggestion, the responder answers, and the initiator buttons with a third line before both head to the opposite line—rapid reps for strong offers and attentive listening.

- Have any number of improvisers form two single file lines on opposite sides of the stage. The line on the left side of the stage will be the "initiation" line. The line on the right will be the "response" line.One improviser from each line will step forward to perform a scene inspired by a suggestion offered by someone else in the group.

- Left Side will initiate.

- Right Side will respond to the initiation.

- Left Side will respond to the response.

- After the three lines, each improviser should go to the end of the opposite line. The next two improvisers in line then step out, get another suggestion, and do a new three-line scene. These three-line scenes will not be complete scenes. They will end after the third line.

- These scenes don't have to reach any sort of resolution. You should still make strong choices and commit as if these are going to be full-length scenes.

-  Continue until everyone has had a chance to respond
