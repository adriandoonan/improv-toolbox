A group of improvisers creates a back-line.

One improviser steps off of the backline to be the character monologist.

On the back-line, assign two improvisers to provide adjectives, and one improviser to provide a name.

On the count of three, the assigned improvisers on the back-line yell out the adjectives and name.

The character monologist immediately takes on these adjectives and introduces themselves in character.

Example: 1…2…3! "Smelly!" "Creepy!" "Carl!"

**Smelly Creepy Carl: **(sniff) "Hi girls. I'm Carl. Sorry about the smell. That's why I came into the ladies' room…"

After they have performed a one-minute monologue as this character, start over with a new volunteer from the back-line.
