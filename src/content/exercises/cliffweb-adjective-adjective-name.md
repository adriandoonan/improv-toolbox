name: "Adjective, Adjective, Name"
purpose: "Characters"
shortDescription: "This exercise allows you to practice performing character monologues without the burden of coming up with characteristics yourself."
description: |
  A group of improvisers creates a back-line.
  
  One improviser steps off of the backline to be the character monologist.
  
  On the back-line, assign two improvisers to provide adjectives, and one improviser to provide a name.
  
  On the count of three, the assigned improvisers on the back-line yell out the adjectives and name.
  
  The character monologist immediately takes on these adjectives and introduces themselves in character.
  
  Example: 1…2…3! "Smelly!" "Creepy!" "Carl!"
  
  **Smelly Creepy Carl: **(sniff) "Hi girls. I'm Carl. Sorry about the smell. That's why I came into the ladies' room…"
  
  After they have performed a one-minute monologue as this character, start over with a new volunteer from the back-line.
