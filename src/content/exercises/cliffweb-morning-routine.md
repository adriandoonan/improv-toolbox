8 up, 4 on stage, 4 facing them sat on chairs (backs to the audience). The 4 on stage simultaneously mime a part of their morning routine for a few minutes.
After the time has been called the instructor should ask the partners what happened in the scene, also what they liked.
Now the ones on stage should go again, this time they are instructed to make something happen in the scene that will evoke an emotional change. Cutting yourself shaving, can’t find the cat, break something - something grounded. Again the partners should be quizzed - and of course the players can chime in too.
Now the scene is replayed and this time some object evokes a memory and this memory informs the deal for the player, such as seeing a scar in the mirror, an old toothbrush, a mug from a holiday.
Everyone should have a chance to play all parts.
