  For all players. One person says "I'm having a [blank] themed wedding" say, "I'm having a Nintendo themed wedding". The other players - and the original one can then reason what they would have at that wedding.
  
  - The cake would be a mushroom
  
  - The gifts are on the ceiling and you have to bash your head against them to get the gifts out.
  
  - The food is whole chickens and potions
  
  - Here comes the bride is played in 8-bit
  
  - Instead of a ring it's a powerglove
  
  when it's run out of steam someone says "Good wedding" and everyone agrees
