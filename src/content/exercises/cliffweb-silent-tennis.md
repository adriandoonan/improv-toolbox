name: "Silent Tennis"
purpose: "ObjectWork"
shortDescription: "A strong deal makes the game or plot irrelevant. it should be obvious even without words."
description: |
  2 up. Each person chooses a deal, it can be something broad like happy or angry, but it can be something specific like - I slept with your partner, I love babies, I’m being attacked by bees.
  
  The 2 players initiate a game of tennis, it should be stressed that the tennis itself is highly unimportant, in fact if no ball is hit that’s fine, great even! The players should find a way to heighten their deal too.
  
  The players should be instructed not to mime, but to act natural, just the scene has been muted.
