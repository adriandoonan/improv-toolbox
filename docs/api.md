# Improv Toolbox — API (Draft)

_Last updated: 2025-10-02_

## Purpose

Catalogue the data contracts for any APIs the toolbox consumes or exposes so contributors can build against stable shapes.

## Status

- **Owner:** Adrian Doonan
- **Completion target:** Align with first external integration
- **Current state:** Placeholder — no external API surface yet.

## Planned Sections

1. **Internal content schemas** — reference the front matter fields for exercises, warmups, forms, tools.
2. **Suggestion sources** — document third-party endpoints (e.g., random-word API) with rate limits and fallbacks.
3. **Future write APIs** — submission endpoints for community contributions (TBD).
4. **Authentication & security** — requirements once user-generated content lands.

## Next Steps

- Export current TypeScript types for content collections and link here.
- Capture request/response samples for the suggestion APIs now in use.
- Define versioning strategy before exposing write operations.
